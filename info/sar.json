This team collaborates with special education teachers within SVVSD to help them interact with students through the Misty Robotics platform (pictured above). We also build skills for the Misty Robotics platform that allowed the robot to interact with people using facial recognition. In summer 2022, the team and I presented at the <a href='https://conference.csteachers.org/event/6f29f862-5cb3-4b19-9f5a-3bd007da8ef6/summary' target='_blank'>2022 InnEdCo conference</a> in Breckenridge, Co.<br><br><a href='https://github.com/cogrpar/MistyAssistiveRoboticsExamples' target='_blank'>Misty Skills on GitHub</a>"
