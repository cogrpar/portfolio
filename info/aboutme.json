  "text": "I am Owen Welsh, and I am interested in many subjects including physics, computer science, and mathematics. I am a student with a love of learning and an interest in emerging technologies. I find that the best way to learn about these exciting technologies is with a hands-on, project-based approach.  This portfolio contains some of the projects that I have completed over the years.<br><br>Contact: <a href='mailto:owen.r.welsh@gmail.com'>owen.r.welsh@gmail.com</a>"
